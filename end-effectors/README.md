# Different End Effectors Developed for the Robotic Arm

Contains different end-effectors capabale of mounting to the arm and interfacing with software.

## Making you own
**IMPORTANT. WHEN CONNECTING END EFFECTORS TO THE DATA BUS THE I2C LINES NEEDS TO WORK ON A 3.3 VOLT VOLTAGE LEVEL. OTHERWISE THE MOTOR CONTROLLING MICROCHIPS WILL BE FRIED.**  

This can be done through using chip that works on a 3.3 volt voltage level or using level shifters.
