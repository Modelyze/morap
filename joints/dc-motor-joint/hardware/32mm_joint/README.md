## Bill of materials
* DC-motor equipped with a Maxon GPX32 gearhead or similar dimensions
* 2x bearing of type SKF 7208 or equivalent
* 8x 10mm M3 screws
* 4x M3 nuts
* 8x M3 bricks
* 4x M3 spacer 5/5mm 
* 8x M6 bricks
* 4x M6 15mm screws
* 4x M6 nuts
* 1x M5 nut
* Some glue (epoxy or superglue)

## 3D-printing guidelines
All of the parts have been successfully printed in PLA-plastic, which is preferable to ABS-plastic due to being more stiff. However, especially the high load bearing parts, can be printed in more robust plastic such as XT.

100% infill has been used on all parts in order to maximize strength bearing capability and minimize elasticity. Support is used everywhere and needs to be properly removed after the print is finished.

## Assembly
The assembly procedure is mostly the same as with the the [22mm joint](../22mm_joint) with a few differences.

One is that no metal connector for 8mm axis exists so one has to make their own.

An M5-nut should be inserted into the attacher and glued in place there to keep it in place. A screw can be used in order to make sure it's all the way in. The backside nut should also be glued in place. In addition, in order to somewhat increase the attachers ability to take loads it can be covered in epoxy glue.

This shaft attacher is then pushed up the motor shaft as far as it can before fastening the rest of the joint.
